        <h1>Summary: Latitude vs Max Temp</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather patterns change with change in latitude
           latitude in northern and southern hemispheres. We used citypy module and Openweather API to
           randomly select 500 cities around the world. We extracted different weather related data such 
           as maximum temperature, cloudiness, humidity, windspeed for all the cities in on the date the 
           API call was made. We, then, used matplotlib to plot weather data and make comparisons 
           between the northern and southern hemispheres.
